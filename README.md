# LocalNotePro
This is my note taking web app. I used the local storage to save the notes. You can view your previous notes and then delete them.

I used JavaScript and jQuery for the functionality. 
Bootstrap and own css for the style.

If you clear your history/cookies then the notes will disapear since they are stored in local storage. 
I noticed a bug in chrome, where local storage will not clear when you delete your histroy/cookies. That is if you are running this locally.
